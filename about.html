    <!-- <br>
    <br>
    Ever since I was in high school I wanted to become an engineer. I had the curiosity to know how
    automobiles worked and the engineering behind it. When it was time to go to college, mechanical
    engineering seemed like a natural choice for me. I had to admit, I wasn't the best nor was it
    easy. But knowing that I wanted to someday work with cars kept me going. Through money saving
    (and student loans), I pursuited a master's degree in automotive engineering so that someday, my
    goals would become a reality.
    <br>
    <br>
    Fast foward to my first internship and I realized that sitting behind a computer and using <a
        class="a-text" href="#">MATLAB</a> made me a very happy intern. I had
    some previous experience with it and every time I used it I had the same feeling. I chose to
    continue working with MATLAB for my second internship as my skills were starting to build around
    programming and problem solving. After finishing my second internship, I was lucky enough to
    stay in order to work on a project that dealt with C++. I had never thought that I was ever
    going to use this programming language and still I needed to convert MATLAB code to C++ code.
    The strange thing I found out, It was easier than what I thought!
    <br>
    <br>
    From that moment on, I knew that I could start learning a new skill that would open new
    possibilities. Once I finished my second internship,
    I finally had the time to come back home and keep myself busy. But... where do I even begin?
    Having been abroad gave me the confidence to start a project by myself and I already had some
    ideas in mind. What kind of ideas? A couple of mobile apps. So, I've had the time and I've had
    the ideas, what was the next step? Well, Why not start <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">
        from the bottom</span> with the basics?
    <br>
    <br>
    I started with HTML, CSS & Javascript. By learning the basics of web development, I was able to
    start using a framework called <a class="a-text" href="#">Ionic</a>. It
    used <a class="a-text" href="#">Angular</a> as the base framework and thus
    it was imperative to learn it (I was using Ionic v3 at the time). After a couple of months of
    building my first app, I did my first test on a real device and it was such a let down at the
    moment. The performance was not what I expected and I knew that I had to start over with an
    alternative framework. That's when I found <a class="a-text"
        href="#">Flutter</a>. Thanks to this mobile SDK, I has able to build the same app from the
    ground up, in less time, with better features and functioning on both platforms (iOS and
    Android). -->
